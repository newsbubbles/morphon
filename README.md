# Morphon
A 3D Iterated Function System which generates a colored plot and can plot a million points in realtime (on decent consumer hardware).  The focus of Morphon is to explore the fractal nature of shapes or fields which affect each other to cause morphological changes in each other at the same time.

Here's an explainer video which also gets into some of the reasons and possible use cases of this math: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LW9_zolLkE

## Features
- Usable Anywhere: Mobile friendly WebGL interface
- Fast: > 60FPS animated point cloud at 200,000 points on an RTX 3060Ti
- Realtime non-linear audio visualization breaks the audio spectrum up into parameters for the fractal
- Accurate: Correctly plots the fractal given the seed shape, morphic shape, and input shape
- Great for Audio Reactive Music Visualization
- Every frame is a unique point cloud which fits within the field generated by the fractal

Here are some screenshots of the visuals I've been creating with it:
